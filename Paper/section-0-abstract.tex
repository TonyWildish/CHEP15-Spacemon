\begin{abstract}


Storage capacity at CMS Tier-1 and Tier-2 sites reached over 100 Petabytes in 2014, and will be substantially increased during Run 2 data taking. The allocation of storage for the individual users analysis data, which is not accounted as a centrally managed storage space, will be increased to up to 40\%. For comprehensive tracking and monitoring of the storage utilization across all participating sites, CMS developed a Space Monitoring system, which provides a central view of the geographically dispersed heterogeneous storage systems. The first prototype has been deployed at the pilot sites in summer 2014, and has been substantially reworked since then. In this presentation we discuss the functionality and our experience of system deployment and operation on the full CMS scale.
