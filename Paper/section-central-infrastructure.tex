\subsection {DMWMMON Database as Information store}


\subsection {Data Service as interface to Information store}

\subsection {SiteDb as authentication authority}



\subsection {DashBoard as es end-user visualization tool}

The goals of the visualization are to present the space monitoring information in a convenient form, enabling the users to check space usage across the sites, explore the historical views or drill down into a particular directory in the CMS storage namespace, and eventually help planning and optimize the storage resource usage.We have recently started work with WLCG developers to implemented the visualization of the sites space monitoring information in the CMS dashboard.

Design is similar to that of the ATLAS DDM storage accounting [5] based on rucio storage summaries [6]. The challenge in CMS case is to represent uniformly the monitoring data asynchronously pushed by the sites.
