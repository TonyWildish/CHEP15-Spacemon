2\section {Summary}

CMS space monitoring is designed to provide a central view of space occupied by 
all CMS data stored in heterogeneous storage systems deployed at CMS sites. 
Storage dumps produced locally by the sites include user areas and CMS production 
data not accounted in the CMS central data catalogues. Central infrastructure has 
been deployed as CMS web service at CERN and started collecting data uploaded by 
the sites. In the course of the deployment campaign all system components 
benefited from the improvements based on feedback from the sites. Remaining steps 
are: complete deployment at CMS sites and provide the visualization.
